Hi, I’m @pH4Nt0mmmy 

I’ve been passionate about coding since I was 11 years old, and Python has been my go-to language ever since.
As a high school student, I constantly seek new challenges to grow as a programmer and problem solver.
Coding isn’t just a skill for me — it’s a companion. Whenever life gets challenging, I turn to coding to find clarity and purpose.

Current Focus:
	• Building efficient and innovative software solutions
	• Exploring AI and machine learning concepts
	• Contributing to open-source projects

Future Goals:
	• Developing impactful projects that solve real-world problems
	• Expanding my expertise in full-stack development and data science
	• Collaborating with passionate developers across the globe
